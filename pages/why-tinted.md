# Why Tinted?

If you've been datapack-ing for a while, you probably have your own set of ever-evolving conventions. Scoreboard objectives are named like this, public functions go in this folder, inputs are specified like this, etc. If you are anything like me, you have these conventions just floating in your own head, maybe even vaguely outlined somewhere in a text document. For whatever reason it may be, this is usually where they stay.

The obvious problem is, even if your personal conventions are the best in the world:\
_**Nobody else knows them.**_

So what separates Tinted from anybody else's conventions?\
Aside from being documented and complete, _nothing_. \
With that being said, I truly do believe that Tinted can be useful to any datapack developer, and the _**last**_ thing I want is Tinted to stifle anybody's own creative process, which is why it puts zero restrictions on private file structure, and is designed to be as **unobtrusive** as possible everywhere else.

If you have any disagreements or problems with Tinted, please, don't hesitate to let me know, or heck, make something even better.

### Regarding:

<details>

<summary><a href="https://wiki.smithed.dev/">Smithed</a></summary>

Smithed is an awesome project that I personally would like to see grow (and possibly collaborate with), but as it stands, the Smithed conventions are sparse and incomplete.

Because of Smith's [tag specification](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/tag-specification/), Tinted and Smithed are technically not compatible.

This project has some absolutely great ideas that could be implemented alongside Tinted, but are out of scope of Tinted itself. Very unfortunately, it seems to be abandoned.&#x20;
